## Getting Started

This project is based on Lando.

To set up your local environment and begin developing for this project, refer to the [Lando documentation](https://docs.lando.dev/). Kindly note that you do not need to run `lando init` as the project already contains a `.lando.yml`. You also need to run `composer install` in order to install Drupal 9.
